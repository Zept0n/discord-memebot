# discord-memebot

## Overview
discord-memebot is a simple discord bot for random memes fetched from Reddit using a meme API. The core of the bot is built with Node.js and it uses Discord.js for interacting with the Discord API.
It was hosted straight on replit.com using a simple express server that was being kept alive by periodic pings from uptimerobot. That prevented the bot from going offline due to inactivity.

## Usage
commands:
- `/meme`: Receive a random meme from the default subreddit.
- `/meme subreddit` command includes an optional parameter called 'subreddit.' This parameter allows users to specify a subreddit from which they want to fetch a random meme.

## Installation 
- deprecated
